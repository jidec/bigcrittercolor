History of knowledge development (i.e. specific thinkers) is not emphasized
Methods and study systems may be defined either like “Basic Genetics // Methods” or like “Basic Genetics // Gene expression // Methods”

Philosophy of Science ✰
Epistemology - the nature and limits of knowledge
Empiricism - knowledge comes from sensory experience (Bacon, Hume)
vs. Rationalism -  logic, math, metaphysics etc. can be separate from experience and hold knowledge (Descartes)
Falsifiability - science can only examine predictions than can be decisively proven wrong 	(Popper)
Theory-Ladenness - pre-existing theories corrupt observation
Underdetermination - obtainable evidence isn’t enough for belief 

Methodological concepts
	Hypothesis - a testable prediction based on prior expectation
Deduction - general principles to specific instances

Induction - generalizing from specific observations

Interpretations of science
	Realism - what we perceive exists independently
vs. Idealism - does not
Scientific realism - supported info is approximately true, entities are real
vs. Skepticism - not really 
Positivism - method is easy and universal based on verifiable observation
Instrumentalism - theories are just tools
Reductionism - explanations should be linked to smaller parts 
Foundationalism - proven statements stand on their own as true
vs. Coherentism - true knowledge must be consistent with other true knowledge

Historical context and edifice
	Teleology - describing things in terms of purpose rather than cause (Plato & Aristotle)
Paradigm - defines the norms and practices of scientific disciplines (Kuhn)
Scientific Revolution - fundamental shifts in scientific understanding occur 
Demarcation criterion - science from non- via falsifiability

Probability & Statistics ✰
Probability axioms - foundations of all prob.
	First prob axiom - the prob of an event is a non-negative real number
	Second prob axiom - prob that any event will occur is 1 (something must happen) 
Third prob axiom - if probs A and B are mutually exclusive, the prob of A or B is prob A + prob B
Probability interpretations - prob has 3 meanings: frequentist, propensity, and Bayesian 
Frequentist statistics - events tend to occur at a consistent rate given traits - stable frequencies ONLY exist for large ensembles, can only discuss probability when describing ensembles, not single cases, propositions are true or not
Propensity - stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of causative invariant single-case probs 
Bayesian probability - assign degrees of belief to any statement based on prior evidence
Bayes’ Theorem - describes the probability of an event given prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that event, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
Conditional probability - the prob of an event given another event has occurred - the fraction of prob B associated with A, P(A|B) = P(AuB) / P(B)
	Posterior probability - the outcome of BF
	Prior probability - P(A) and P(B) in BF

Model - a mathematical approximation of a phenomenon (often interactions between variables)

R-squared - proportion of variation in dependent that is PREDICTED by independent 
Correlation - ANY relationship between variables 
Pearson product-moment coefficient - ratio of covariance of two vars normalized by sqrt of variance 

	Spearman correlation - cor that is monotonic, but not necessarily linear
		Monotonic - a function that ONLY increases or ONLY decreases 

Error - distance of an observed quantity from the actual theoretical quantity like a mean i.e. trait = 2 when pop mean = 3

Permutation test - assess the significance of differences between groups by comparing the t statistic to a distribution of t statistics generated by repeatedly shuffling data points among groups.
Model selection - process of selecting among models the one that best fits the data
AIC - a measure of model quality that balances fit (likelihood) with number of params based on minimizing the information loss

BIC - stronger penalty against more params
Stepwise variable selection - add and remove variables to model with goal of balancing complexity with predictive power - greedy and can lead to overfitting
Causal statistics
Reverse causation - every if all variables are known, it could be that animals going extinct is causing climate change - only true if we can’t investigate mechs in ANY way
Common cause / confounder -  if X <- Z -> Y, Z is a confounder

Collider - if X -> Z <- Y, Z is a collider and if we accidentally condition on Z, Y will falsely appear to have an effect on X 

Model misspecification - not all relationships are linear and not all distributions are normal, making regressions even of all variables non-causal
Identifiable - theoretically possible to learn the true values of this model's underlying parameters after obtaining an infinite number of obs, i.e. different values of the params must generate different prob distr of the observable variables.

Groupings
	Monophyletic

	Internal specifier
	External specifier
	Qualifier - a specifier that must be in place or definition breaks and is invalid

Hennig - founder of cladistics/phylogenetic systematics, coined synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy, paraphyly in Phylogenetic Systematics 1966 which was slow to catch due to not being translated
Number of possible trees - with 200 the n is more than atoms in the universe - compute expensive - for a while people thought you could only ever do 4 at a time!

Weighted parsimony - weight based on more difficult to evolve changes (may bring assumptions, but unweighted still has “weights”) 
Parsimony shorts - pars gets a lot worse if homo is common or biased OR rates of change of traits are biased (happens a TON) 
Long branch attraction - lineage looks related to another long-branched lineage just because they have both had lots of change rather than because they are related by descent - adding characters doesn’t help, but adding samples does 

PAUP - classic parsimony software

Storing phylogenetic data - 
Polytomy - 3 branches from the same node - can be real or not 
Reliability of trees
	Number of trees - popular in old parsimony, 2 trees better than 1000 
	Branch lengths 
	Consistency and retention
	Decay index - parsim only, examine trees longer than shortest, see if clades hold up
	Bootstrapping in phylo - resample random characters (loci) with replacement and value is percent of trees in which clade holds - simple & elegant - sim studies find nonlinear relationship between truth and bootstrap where >70% tends to be true

	Jackknifing-
Consensus tree - summarize topologies of multiple trees 
	Strict - clade must appear in ALL trees
	Semi-strict - clade must not be contradicted i.e. polytomy is ok 
	Majority-rule - clade just needs to be in majority 
Combine vs. not combine genetic data - combine bc faster and use total evidence to come up with best abductive hypothesis - don’t combine bc trees from incongruent data are misleading - OR combine congruent only - hot topic

Parameterized reporting - passing params (often different data) to a qmd i.e. params: /n /t data1:null
targets - workflow tool emphasizing reproducibility & automation across inputs and outputs
	tar_make()
Modeling
	car 
	vif 
	rr2 
	lme4 
	brms
	performance 
	sjplot 
	Brms
ppcheck() - perform Bayesian posterior predictive check to compare observed data with data simulated from the posterior predictive distribution to evaluate fit

ggplot2 cheat sheet - https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf
ggplot(df, aes(x=Genus)) + geom_bar() - bar point of counts of a factor

plotly - use to plot 3D scatters, has different syntax than ggplot
cor.test - test a correlation and its significance 
hist - plot a histogram showing the frequency distribution of different values of a variable
effect pkg - use plot(allEffects(model))
colorEvoHelpers
	bindX() - takes a df and returns that df with column X bound to it
	getPlotX() - plots then returns X 

Python Programming 
PyTorch 
	torch.Tensor - a special array with autograd support that also holds its gradient 
	nn.Module - a module that encapsulates params and contains helpers
  	nn.Parameter - a tensor automatically registered as param when added to a Module
	autograd.Function 
Autograd - in FP: compute tensor, maintain gradient function - in BP: compute gradients, accumulate in each tensors, propagate using chain rule - autodefines backward() function 
Testing
	Pytest 

Command-Line Programming
cd - change directory 
mkdir - make a new directory
rm - remove a file
cp - copy a file or directory from source to destination
ls - list files 
-1 - causes each entry to be printed on a new line
wc - counts number of words
-l - counts number of lines instead [ls -1 | wc -l] 
echo - print subsequent text
| - pipe symbol that takes output of left and uses it for command on the right

Deprecated / WIP
Multiplication rule for outcomes - for 3 experiments with x,y,z outcomes, num outcomes is x*y*z - for without replacement use factorial 
Permutations - if order matters, the number of combos of n objects taken r at a time C_r = n! / r! (n - r)!
	With repetition - n^r where r is the number of times 
	Without repetition - n! = n * n-1 * n-2 …
Combinations - name for combos of objects if order doesn't matter 
Estimator - a formula for calculating an estimate for a property of a system given observed data - i.e. sample mean is an estimator of population mean
Point/interval estimator - return a value/interval of possible values i.e. confidence interval
Lincoln-peterson estimator - get likelihood of outcome given num species and num obs in common in mark recapture - estimate pop size 

Incommensurability
Hume’s problem of induction 
Fallibalism
Vs. Infallibalism 
Infinite regress 
Intersubjectivity 

No miracles argument - how do all these things work if gravity isn’t real 
Partial truths or likelihood - 
First principles - weird basal systems that for some reason took for granted 

Logic 
Validity -  statement makes sense logically
Soundness - statement is valid and actually corresponds with the world
If then statement - 
If not then not statement 
Teleology - describing things in terms of purpose rather than cause 
Hume
Relations of ideas - definition statements
Kant
Analytic statement
Synthetic statement 
Synthetic apropriri - specieal cases where concepts dont come from the world rather from combining complex logical statements, it is sort of new knowledge

Genesis engine - a process model with population units, spatially explicit, deep time
Genetic diversity - amount of DNA/RNA variation in a population or species
	Gene diversity - proportion of polymorphic loci across genome
	Nucleotide diversity - amount of nucleotide polymorphisms such as SNPs

Cytochrone c oxidate subunit I (COI) - a molecular market often used because it is found in so many sequenced taxa 

Opsin model system - molecular basis for spectral tuning and UV vision in fishes forward
Lac operon model system - 


Style transfer - applying the visual appearance (or "style") of one image to transform the content of another image - works by iteratively modifying a copy of the original to minimize the distance in style feature space

Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway - small changes can lead to large ones in floral hue or saturation
Core enzymes - white boxes=enzymes, gray=intermediate metabolites














MYB genes - shown to control some of the downstream elements of path and transition to white 

ABC model of flower development - works in 80% of angios - gymnos have no A, just male and female cone genes 
Fading borders model - basal angiosperm gene expression is more continuous 
Paired vs median fins in fish - median gene was expressed in a different place to get paired rather than reinvented
